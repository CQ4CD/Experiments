# CQ4CD Experiments
This repository contains workflows to analyze and compare GitHub/GitLab CI/CD pipeline job scheduling behaviour.
We are currently looking into how GitHub and GitLab schedule independent parallel pipeline jobs.
See [.gitlab-ci.yml](.gitlab-ci.yml) and  the 
[unfair-test-workflow.yml](.github/workflows/unfair-test-workflow-limited.yml)
for workflows that demonstrate scheduling behaviour with known job lengths.

This repository is maintained by the DOS group of the University of Hamburg in the context of the 
[CQ4CD](https://gepris.dfg.de/gepris/projekt/517274090?language=en)
(Continuous Quality Control for Continuous Delivery Architectures) project.
